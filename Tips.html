<b><u>Health Tips</u></b><br><br>


    • Prefer homemade foods against fast food.<br><br>
    • Avoid junk foods as they are a major cause of obesity.<br><br>
    • Eat raw fruits and vegetables whenever possible. It is even preferable to have fruits and raw vegetables instead of munching on snacks.<br><br>
    • Limit consumption of sugar and unhealthy processed foods.<br><br>
    • Keep your salt intake to less than 5 grams per day as it helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease. Prefer iodized salt.<br><br>
    • Avoid trans fats that is found in processed food, fast food, snacks, fried food, frozen pizza and cookies.<br><br>
    • Serve yourself small portions of high calorie foods and large portions of healthy foods like vegetables, salads and soups.<br><br>
    • Good nutrition need not always be expensive. You can get all the nutrients from low cost foods items as well like beans and lentils, eggs, jaggery, seasonal fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables.<br><br>
    • Don’t be choosy over the foods you eat. It might relish your taste buds but it would lead to imbalanced nutrition.<br><br>
    • Eat fresh foods with the minimum of processing.<br><br>
    • Eat raw vegetables whenever possible. If you need to cook them, use as little water as possible because many nutrients are destroyed by heat or boiled water.<br><br>
    • Eat fruits and vegetables with skins (apart from carrots, which can absorb toxins from the soil). Wash them thoroughly first.<br><br>
    • Don't cut, wash or soak fruits and vegetables until you are ready to eat them.<br><br>
    • Avoid replacing meals with snack foods.<br><br>

<b><u>Non-Vegetarians</u></b><br><br>

<b><u>Raw meat, poultry and seafoods</u></b><br><br>

    • Meat items should be stored in the coldest part of your refrigerator. These foods should be stored under refrigeration, preferably at a temperature of 10 C or less, which retards multiplication of microorganisms.<br><br>
    • Before storing chilled chicken for a couple of days, it is a good idea to take off the plastic wrapping, wash the chicken thoroughly, dry it with a paper towel then store as above.<br><br>
    • Fresh whole fish should be gutted and washed if it is to be stored for more than 24 hours.<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Cooked meat, poultry and seafoods</u></b><br><br>

    • Meat, poultry and seafoods must be refrigerated as soon as possible after cooking.<br><br>
    • To avoid condensation, do not cover hot meat pieces before refrigerating.<br><br>
    • Store cooked products above any raw meat, poultry or seafoods to avoid cross contamination.<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>What about personal hygiene?</u><br><br>

    • Food handlers should observe good personal hygiene to maintain food safety. They should be free from obvious signs of illness, wounds and sores.<br><br>
    • Use of spoons and ladles should be encouraged to avoid contamination. Avoid cooked food is touched by the hands while preparing, serving and eating.<br><br>
    • Hands should be washed thoroughly before starting the preparation of food and after every interruption.<br><br>
    • Household pets like cats and dogs often harbour dangerous pathogens. They should be kept away from places where food is cooked, stored or served.<br><br>

<b><u>Removal of the Pesticide Residues from the Food products by different methods (How to minimize effects of pesticides)</u></b><br><br>
Most of the pesticide residues can be removed by adopting four methods of residues removal. These methods should be easily adopted at the house hold level to remove the pesticide residual contamination. These methods are washing, blanching, peeling and cooking.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Washing</b><br><br>


    • The first step in the removal of pesticide residues from the food products is washing. Washing with 2% of salt water will remove most of the contact pesticide residues that normally appear on the surface of the vegetables and fruits. About 75-80% of pesticide reduces are removed by cold water washing.<br><br>
    • The pesticide residues that are on the surface of the grapes, apples, guava, plums, mangoes, peaches, pears etc, fruity vegetables like tomatoes, brinjal, and okra require 2-3 washings.<br><br>
    • The green leafy vegetables must be washed thoroughly. The pesticide residues from green leafy vegetables are removed satisfactorily by normal processing such as washing blanching and cooking.<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Blanching</b><br><br>


A short treatment in hot water or steam applied to most of the vegetables. Certain pesticide residues can effectively be removed by blanching. But before blanching it is very important to thoroughly pre-wash the vegetables &fruits etc.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Peeling</b><br><br>


Contact pesticides that appear on the surface of the fruits and vegetables can be removed by peeling.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Cooking</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Animal Products</b><br><br>


Animal products are also the major source of contamination for pesticide residues in human diets since the animals feed on fodder, which are sprayed with pesticides. Pressure cooking, frying and baking will remove pesticide residues from the animal fat tissues.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Dairy products</b><br><br>


Boiling of milk at elevated temperatures will destroy the persistent pesticide residues.<br><br>


<b>Vegetable Oils</b><br><br>

Refined oils will have fewer amounts of pesticide residues. Household heating of oils up to a particular flash point will remove pesticide residues.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>What are the common adulterants?</b><br><br>


    • Foods may be adulterated with non-food material or inferior quality product. Spoilt, stale or poor quality food is made attractive and fresh by adding harmful colors or other chemicals.<br><br>
    • Frequently adulterated food items are milk and milk products, cereals, pulses and their products, edible oils and spices. The different classes of adulterants include non-permitted colors like yellow; non-edible oils like castor oil; cheaper agricultural produce like various starches in milk powder; extraneous matter like husk, sand and sawdust; and metal contaminants like aluminum or iron filings.<br><br>
    • Consumption of adulterated foods could lead to disease outbreaks of epidemic proportions. Buying from a reliable and reputed source, careful checking of foods before purchase and insisting on certified brands will all minimize the risk of food adulteration.<br><br>
    • Please visit Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) (http://www.fssai.gov.in/Portals/0/Pdf/Final_test_manual_part_I(16-08-2012).pdf) to know more about household tests, which could be done easily at your home.

<b>Healthy Cooking Practices</b><br><br>
Foods, in their natural state, contain different nutrients in varying amounts. Cooking improves the digestibility of most foods. Raw food get softened on cooking and become easily chewable. Proper methods of cooking render food healthy.   Positive food concepts and cooking practices are foundation for good health by improving the appearance, taste, flavour and texture, thereby enhancing acceptability. Cooking process also helps to eliminate disease causing organisms and destroy natural inhibitors of digestion. Cooking food is a common thing in our homes, but it is good if we follow healthy cooking practices. We can classify the food cooking process in three stages such as:<br><br>
    • Precooking Preparation<br><br>
    • Washing and cutting of raw food<br><br>
    • Cooking Methods<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Precooking Preparation:</u></b><br><br>

According to the food preparation, the cooking process of any food may include washing, grinding, cutting, fermentation, germination and cooking. In Indian cuisine, fermentation (process used in making idli, dosa, dhokla) and germination (sprouting) are common practices. These methods improve digestibility and increase nutrients such as B-complex vitamins and Vitamin C.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b><u>Washing and Cutting of raw food:</u></b><br><br>

Raw food may contain pesticide residues, parasites and other extraneous material. In order to clean the same, foods should be washed well before cooking and consumption to remove these contaminants. Vegetables and fruits should be washed thoroughly with   clean water before cutting. Cutting of vegetables in to small pieces exposes a greater surface area of the foodstuff to the atmosphere, resulting in loss of vitamins due to oxidation. Therefore, vegetables should be cut in to large pieces. Cut vegetables should not be soaked at all in water as water-soluble minerals and vitamins get washed away. However, certain precautions should be taken while washing and cutting to minimize the loss of nutrients. Avoid repeated washing of food grains like rice and pulses as it might lead to loss of certain minerals and vitamins.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Cooking Methods:</u></b><br><br>

There are many methods of cooking like boiling, steaming, pressure cooking, frying, roasting and baking. Boiling is the most common method of cooking, but because of this process some heat-labile and water-soluble vitamins like vitamin B-complex and C is lost. Cooking rice with excess of water may lead to the loss of nutrient value so just use sufficient water to be fully absorbed. To avoid loss of vitamins, use of baking soda for hastening cooking of pulses should not be practiced. Repeated heating of oils particularly Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA)-rich oils results in formation of peroxides and free radicals hence, should be avoided by using just enough oil. Similarly, oils which have been repeatedly heated should not be mixed with fresh oil but should be used for process such as seasoning.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Some common Indian food beliefs, fads and taboos:</b><br><br>

Food habits are formed early in childhood, passed on from the elders in the family and perpetuated to adulthood. Food beliefs either encourage or discourage the consumption of particular type of foods. There can be neutral, harmless or harmful practices. Unfortunately, most of the food fads and prejudices (taboos) are associated with women and children, who are also the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Exaggerated beneficial or harmful claims in respect of some foods, without scientific basis constitute food fads. In addition, the belief of heat producing and cold inducing foods is widely prevalent. Here are some examples:<br><br>
    • Jaggery, sugar, groundnuts, fried foods, mango, bajra, jowar, maize, eggs and meat are considered as hot.<br><br>
    • Buttermilk, curd, milk, green gram dhal, green leafy vegetables, ragi, barley flour and apples are considered as cold inducing foods.<br><br>
    • Papaya fruit is strongly suspected to lead to abortion, though there is no scientific basis.<br><br>
    • Vegetarianism is often practiced in India on religious grounds. Since vitamin B12 is present only in foods of animal origin, vegetarians should ensure an adequate consumption of milk.<br><br>
    • During certain illnesses like measles and diarrhoea, dietary restriction is practiced.

<b><u>Diet and Weight Management</u></b><br><br>
A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. It shall have enough calories for good health, but not so much that it makes you overweight.
A healthy eating plan is the one with low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for overweight /obesity, heart disease and other related conditions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Healthy foods include:</u></b><br><br>

    • Fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yoghurt, cheese, and milk.<br><br>
    • Protein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas.<br><br>
    • Whole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. Other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers.<br><br>
    • Fresh fruits, canned, frozen, or dried.<br><br>
    • Fresh vegetables, canned (without salt), frozen or dried.<br><br>
